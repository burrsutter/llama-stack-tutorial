## Setup 

### Python setup
```
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Check connectivity and registered models on Llama Stack

```
curl -sS http://localhost:8321/v1/models | jq
```

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "identifier": "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct",
      "provider_resource_id": "llama3.2:3b-instruct-fp16",
      "provider_id": "ollama",
      "type": "model",
      "metadata": {},
      "model_type": "llm"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
      "provider_resource_id": "all-minilm:latest",
      "provider_id": "ollama",
      "type": "model",
      "metadata": {
        "embedding_dimension": 384
      },
      "model_type": "embedding"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
      "provider_resource_id": "llama3.1:8b-instruct-fp16",
      "provider_id": "ollama",
      "type": "model",

    }
  ]
}
```

### Check on registered tools

```
curl -sS http://localhost:8321/v1/toolgroups | jq
```


```
export LLAMA_STACK_SERVER=http://localhost:8321
export LLAMA_STACK_MODEL=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
```


### Configure 

comment/uncomment toolgroups and/or shields depending on what you wish to try

```
    agent_config = AgentConfig(
        model=LLAMA_STACK_MODEL,
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant",
        sampling_params={
            "strategy": {"type": "top_p", "temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 0.9},
        },
        toolgroups=[],
        # toolgroups=(
        #     [
        #         # "mcp::my-python-server-math",
        #         "mcp::my-node-server-math",
        #         "mcp::my-node-server-other",
        #         # "mcp::mcp-website-fetcher"
        #     ]
        # ),
        # tool_choice="auto",
        input_shields=["content_safety"],
        output_shields=[],
        enable_session_persistence=True,
    )
